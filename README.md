# x86-router

This is essentially a running notebook of steps, caveats, pointers, etc. as I work to build a fast cheap 10G+ BGP edge router using:

* [Supermicro `5019D-FN8TP`](https://www.supermicro.com/products/system/1u/5019/SYS-5019D-FN8TP.cfm) hardware
* [FD.io VPP](https://fd.io/technology/) for forwarding
* [FRRouting](https://frrouting.org/) for routing

When it's done, tuned, tested, etc. I'll transform this into an actual guide of some kind, and possibly contribute it in some way to the [FRRouting Documentation](http://docs.frrouting.org) if welcome.

The notes/docs themselves can be found in the [docs](https://github.com/checktheroads/x86-router/docs) directory of this repository.
