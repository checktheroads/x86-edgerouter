# Potenial Interface Types
## Ethernet

`<medium> - <speed> - <chassis position> - <port number>`

(Port numbers starting at 1, since that's how they're almost always labeled on the phyiscal chassis)

* Gigabit: `eth-1-0-1`
* 10 Gigabit: `eth-10-0-2`
* 25 Gigabit: `eth-25-1-1`
* 40 Gigabit `eth-40-2-2`
* 100 Gigabit: `eth-100-3-1`

## Wi-Fi

* Onboard: `wlan-0-1`
* PCI: `wlan-1-1`

## Cellular
